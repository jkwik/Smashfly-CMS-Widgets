# Smashfly CMS Widgets
As part of my summer 2018 internship at SmashFly I assisted in the complete overhaul of Smashfly's CMS (Career Marketing Site) platform. This repository houses the widgets that I created during my time working on the project. Some files were discluded from the commit and parts of the code were masked for security purposes :)

## Stack Used
- ASP.NET framework (C#, Razor Pages, Javascript)
- MVC architecture
